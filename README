A caching library that uses the filesystem for storing cached output
in static files which can be served by Apache.

Many PHP applications use Apache's mod_rewrite to create clean URLs. Typically
this involves rewriting requests for missings files to index.php. When this
happens, PHP translates the route, generates the content and responds.

Smart people cache the result to improve speed. This takes the idea one step
further by writing the output to the filesystem, so subsequent requests do not
need to be interpreted by PHP.

For example:
GET /people/124

For this request, the cache key is /people/124, StaticCache will write the 
output to /var/www/html/people/124 and subsequent requests will not be sent
to PHP for interpretation, allowing Apache to do what it does best, serve
static content.

Emptying the cache is as simple as removing the /var/www/html/people directory.
